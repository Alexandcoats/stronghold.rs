## engine

Engine is the collection of low-level modules with which application architects can build higher-level implementations of Strongholds for a variety of purposes. It is platform agnostic, in that it should run anywhere a Rust Compiler will work.

It is composed of 4 primary modules:
- snapshot
- vault
- store
- runtime

For more information on each of these modules, see their associated READMEs.
