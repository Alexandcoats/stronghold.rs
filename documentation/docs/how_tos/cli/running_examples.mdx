# Running Examples

## Command Line Interface(CLI)

You should run the examples from within the [client crate](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/tree/dev/client).
The examples shown in this doc were executed on Linux but should work on the other supported platforms. Make sure to
adapt paths according to your operating system default.

For example, Windows(TM) requires backslashes `\` as a delimiter for a path. This could pose a problem, as
backslashes are also used to escape characters.

You can find the example code in the official
[Stronghold repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/tree/dev/client/examples/cli/main.rs)
